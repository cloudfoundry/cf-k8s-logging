# cf-k8s-logging

cf-k8s-logging contains the portions of cf-for-k8s which enable logging
outcomes.

## values.yml

### Scaling
There are two main subsystems to consider when scaling logging: frontend and
backend.

To scale the frontend to handle more requests, update `log_cache_api_replicas` 
in the values.yml file. 

To scale the backend to handle an increased number of applications and logs, 
update `log_cache_replicas` in the values.yml file. 

DO NOT update the replica set for the log-cache-backend stateful set without
updating the env variable `"NUM_REPLICAS"` to match. 
If `spec.replicas > NUM_REPLICAS`, any additional replicas will not start.  If
`NUM_REPLICAS > spec.replicas`, log-cache will try to contact a replica that
doesn't exist, resulting in dropped logs.

### Log Destinations

To send all app logs to a destination via syslog you can setup app log destinations in
your cf-values.yml file:

```yml
app_log_destinations:
#@overlay/append
- host: <hostname>
  port: <port_number>
  transport: <tls/tcp> #defaults to tls
  insecure_disable_tls_validation: <false/true> #defaults false
#@overlay/append
- host: <hostname>
  port: <port_number>
  transport: <tls/tcp> #defaults to tls
  insecure_disable_tls_validation: <false/true> #defaults false
```

### Debug logging in cf-k8s-logging fluentd

To diagnose issues with Fluentd, you can increase the log level by setting the
environment variable `FLUENTD_FLAGS` on Fluentd, like so
```
env:
- name: "FLUENTD_FLAGS"
  value: "-vvv"
```

`-vvv` is the highest logging level

Another way to see what is being sent is by replacing the output with a stdout
logger:
```
<match **>
    @type stdout
</match>
```

## API

### App Containers
Logs from app containers are automatically ingested and egressed from
cf-k8s-logging. App containers are expected to contain `cloudfoundry.org/`
labels which contain important app information, namely `app_guid` and
`source_type`.

### System Components/Injected Logs
Cloud Foundry components that wish to emit logs on behalf of apps may do so via the
[Fluentd forward input](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/forward). This protocol
consists of tagged log messages encoded in MessagePack over TCP.
Injected logs will be sent to the same destinations as app container logs, as long
as they contain the tags listed below under [Log Format](#log-format).

Logs should be sent to the Fluentd ingress service called
`fluentd-forwarder-ingress` at port `24224` over the Fluent forwarding
protocol. This protocol can be implemented using one of the following client libraries:

* https://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-ruby
* https://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-golang
* https://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-java

or by placing a Fluentd/Fluent Bit pod next to the component with a [`forward` output plugin](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/forward).

Examples are located [in the examples folder](examples).

***NOTE:***  To communicate with the Forwarder API, Istio sidecar injection
must be enabled with the `istio-injection=enabled` label in the component's
namespace.

#### Log Format
Logs emitted to cf-k8s-logging by system components must include the fields:
- `app_id`: id of the app for which the logs are being emitted.
- `instance_id`: id of the instance for which the logs are being emitted.
- `source_type`: source type of the logs. eg. STG
- `log`: log message to emit

```
{"log":"This is a test log from a fluent log producer","app_id":"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111","instance_id":"1", "source_type":"APP"}
```
## Development flow

1. Make needed updates (update vendir, update k8s files, etc).
1. Make local commit (allows reverting of image tags).
1. Run `./scripts/build-images.sh`, setting $REPOSITORY to a docker
   repository you can push to.
1. Run `./scripts/bump-cf-for-k8s.sh` .
    1. Bump cf-for-k8s should add all the kubernetes files needed to run
       integration tests
1. Follow cf-for-k8s deployment steps.

## Running Integration Tests

1. Run `./scripts/bump-cf-for-k8s.sh`. -- this sets up test dependencies to be installed
1. Deploy cf-for-k8s accoding to [the documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s/blob/master/docs/deploy.md)
1. Set the `TEST_API_ENDPOINT` `TEST_USERNAME` `TEST_PASSWORD` environment variables
1. Optionally, set `TEST_SKIP_SSL` environment variable
1. run `./hack/run_integration_tests.sh`
